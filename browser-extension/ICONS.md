# Placeholder Icon Files

The extension needs icon files in PNG format. You can create them using any image editor or online tool.

## Quick Setup - Using Online Converter

1. Go to https://www.iloveimg.com/resize-image or any SVG to PNG converter
2. Upload the `icon.svg` file
3. Create three versions:
   - icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
   - icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
   - icon128.png (128x128 pixels)
4. Save them in this folder

## Alternative - Use Emoji as Placeholder

For now, the extension will work without icons, but you'll see a default puzzle piece icon. Once you add the PNG files, you'll see the custom icon.

## Suggested Design

A simple design could be:
- Green background (#4CAF50)
- Fork and knife icon or recipe book emoji
- Rounded corners for a modern look

Or use an emoji like: 🍳 🍴 📖 👨‍🍳
